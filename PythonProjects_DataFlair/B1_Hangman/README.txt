Hangman Project in Python
The objective of this project is to implement the hangman game using Python. 
This project doesnâ€™t require any external modules rather just need random and time modules of Python. 
Python functions and loops are enough to develop hangman game

The game executes in the terminal, it initializes the parameters in
each main loop, and restarts the main loop if continue is selected.

Use of the random.choice() and time.sleep() modules.
The system module let us to clear the terminal.
The function clear is defined different for each os.
